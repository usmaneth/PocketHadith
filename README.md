# Pocket Hadith
Pocket Hadith is a work-in-progress project that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate authentic hadith from the Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim collections.

# How it works
Simply enter a prompt about how you are feeling, and the AI will respond with a relevant hadith from the Sahih Bukhari or Sahih Muslim collections, along with the reference for the hadith, the original Arabic text, an English translation, and a meaningful way to implement the hadith based on the situation.

# Features
- Authentic hadith from the Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim collections
- Reference for each hadith
- Original Arabic text and English translation
- Suggestions for implementing the hadith in your daily life

# About the project
This project is still a work-in-progress, and we welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me (usmanasim27@gmail.com).

I hope that this app will be a useful tool for finding solace, guidance, and inspiration in the words of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
